## Adjunct therapies

- · Immunotherapy or biotherapy activates the immune system (T-cells and antibodies) to destroy cancer cells. Experimental research is exploring ways to prevent or treat cancer through vaccines.
- · Gene therapy uses viruses or other vectors to introduce new genetic material into tumor cells. This experimental therapy can cause tumor cells to die or increase their susceptibility to other cancer therapies.
- · Hyperbaric oxygen uses oxygen at higher than normal levels to promote wound healing and help fight infection. It may also improve the tumor's responsiveness to radiation and is being studied experimentally. Currently it is being used to help the body naturally remove dead tumor cells and treat radiation necrosis.

Figure 5. The radiation beam is shaped to match the tumor and minimize exposure to normal brain tissue. The colored rings represent the radiation dose level.

picture_counter_6 The image is a cross-sectional view of a brain scan. It shows a tumor with several colored contour lines, likely indicating radiation therapy planning. The legend on the right indicates different radiation dose levels (9.00 Gy, 16.00 Gy, and 32.00 Gy), with corresponding colors. The scan is labeled "AXIAL" and "Slice no. 18".
