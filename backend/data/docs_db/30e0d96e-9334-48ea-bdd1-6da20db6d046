## Resizing images phase

Resizing the images is an essential process to satisfy the requirement of CNN of equally sized input images. In this research, the process of resizing X-ray images has been done to fit all X-ray images to the input size of the used pre-trained CNN models which are VGG19 and EfficientNetB0. Therefore, all images' versions either full or segmented versions were resized to fit the CNNs input image size which is 224 × 224 pixels. To expedite

picture_counter_5 The image is a chest X-ray.

picture_counter_6 The image is an X-ray of a human chest.

picture_counter_7 The image is a chest X-ray showing the rib cage, lungs, and other internal structures.

picture_counter_8 The image is a chest X-ray.

(a) Original COVID-31

picture_counter_9 The image shows a histogram with the x-axis ranging from 0 to 250 and the y-axis ranging from 0 to 3000. The histogram has three main peaks.

( b) Enhanced HE

picture_counter_10 The image is a histogram with the x-axis ranging from 0 to 250 and the y-axis ranging from 0 to 3500. The histogram shows the distribution of data with numerous bars of varying heights.

(c) Enhanced CLAHE

(d) Complement

picture_counter_11 The image shows a histogram with the x-axis ranging from 0 to 250 and the y-axis ranging from 0 to 3000. The histogram is a distribution of data, with the highest frequency of values between 140 and 180. There is a smaller peak around 210.

(e) Histogram of original image

picture_counter_12 The image is a histogram with the x-axis representing pixel intensity values (0-255) and the y-axis representing frequency. The histogram shows a bimodal distribution with peaks around 100 and 150, and a smaller peak near 250.

Mask of COVID-31

picture_counter_15 The image displays a chest X-ray showing the lungs. It is labeled as "Original COVID-31".

picture_counter_16 The image is a chest X-ray.

(D) Complement

picture_counter_17 The image shows a grayscale rendering of a pair of lungs.

picture_counter_18 The image is a chest X-ray.
