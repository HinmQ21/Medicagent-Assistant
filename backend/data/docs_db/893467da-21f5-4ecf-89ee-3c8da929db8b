## Who is affected?

The American Brain Tumor Association estimates that about 40,900 people will be diagnosed with a primary brain tumor in the US this year (rate of 14 per 100,000 people). Metastatic (secondary) brain tumors are more common than primary brain tumors by at least 10 to 1, and they occur in 20% to 40% of cancer patients. The exact number of brain metastases is unknown, but it has been estimated that 98,000 to 170,000 new cases are diagnosed in the US each year. Unfortunately, each year about 12,690 people die of brain tumors in the US. Although brain tumors can occur at any age, they are most common in children 3 to 12 years old and in adults 40 to 70 years old.
