## 3.2.5. Deep Supervision Loss

In DL models, the loss may apply not only to the final decision layer, but also to the intermediate hidden layers. The supervision of hidden layers, known as deep supervision, guides the learning of intermediate features. Deep supervision also addresses the vanishing gradient problem, leading to faster convergence and improves segmentation performance by constraining the feature space. Deep supervision loss appears in several skin lesion segmentation works (He et al., 2017; Zeng and Zheng, 2018; Li et al., 2018a,b; He et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019a; Tang et al., 2019b), where it is computed in multiple layers, at di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent scales. The loss has the general form of a weighted summation of multi-scale segmentation losses:

$$\mathcal { L } _ { d s } ( X, Y ; \theta ) = \sum _ { l = 1 } ^ { m } \gamma _ { l } \mathcal { L } _ { l } ( X, Y ; \theta ),$$

where m is the number of scales, L l is the loss at the l th scale, and GLYPH&lt;13&gt; l adjusts the contribution of di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent losses.

## 3.2.6. Star-Shape Loss

In contrast to pixel-wise losses which act on pixels independently and cannot enforce spatial constraints, the star-shape loss (Mirikharaji and Hamarneh, 2018) aims to capture class label dependencies and preserve the target object structure in the predicted segmentation masks. Based upon prior knowledge about the shape of skin lesions, the star-shape loss, L ssh penalizes discontinuous decisions in the estimated output as follows:

$$\mathcal { L } _ { s s h } ( X, Y ; \theta ) = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } \sum _ { p \in \Omega } \sum _ { q \in \mathcal { I } _ { p c } } \mathbb { 1 } _ { y _ { i p } = y _ { i q } } \times | y _ { i p } - \hat { y } _ { i p } | \times | \hat { y } _ { i p } - \hat { y } _ { i q } |, \\ \intertext { n center. } \mathcal { I } _ { s s h } \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$ } \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime`} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime`}}$$

where c is the lesion center, ' pc is the line segment connecting pixels p and c and, q is any pixel lying on ' pc . This loss encourages all pixels lying between p and q on ' pc to be assigned the same estimator whenever p and q have the same ground-truth label. The result is a radial spatial coherence from the lesion center.
