## Used datasets

In this research, the data obtained from the 'COVID-19 Radiography Database' has been used to apply the proposed framework. The database contains thousands of publicly available benchmark X-ray images and corresponding lung masks. The X-ray images are provided in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format with a resolution of 299 × 299 pixels. The database includes 10,192 Normal cases, 3616 positive COVID-19 cases, 1345 Viral Pneumonia cases, and 6012 Lung Opacity images as shown in Table1. This database was developed by a team from Qatar University, Dhaka University, Bangladesh with cooperators from Malaysia and Pakistan and cooperators of medical   doctors 26 . Figure 1 illustrates samples from different classes in the COVID-19 Radiography Database.


## Preprocessing

The purpose of the pre-processing phase is to prepare the X-ray images for classification using CNN pre-trained models. In this phase, different pre-processing steps are applied to improve the performance of the classification. The pre-processing steps can be summarized as follows:

| Classes         | Normal   |   Positive COVID-19 |   Viral pneumonia |   Lung opacity |
|-----------------|----------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Number of cases | 10,192   |                3616 |              1345 |           6012 |
